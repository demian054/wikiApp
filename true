Chicken A rooster or cock (left) and hen (right) Conservation status Domesticated Scientific classification Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Aves Order: Galliformes Family: Phasianidae Genus: Gallus Species: G. gallus Subspecies: G. g. domesticus Trinomial name Gallus gallus domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758) The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[1] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast Asia, East Asia,[4] and South Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[5] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the \"bird that gives birth every day\" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[6][7][8] Contents 1 Terminology 2 General biology and habitat 2.1 Behavior 2.1.1 Social behaviour 2.1.2 Courtship 2.1.3 Nesting and laying behaviour 2.1.4 Broodiness 2.1.5 Hatching and early life 2.2 Embryology 3 Breeding 3.1 Origins 3.1.1 South America 4 Use by humans 4.1 Farming 4.1.1 Reared for meat 4.1.2 Reared for eggs 4.2 As pets 4.3 Artificial incubation 5 Diseases and ailments 6 In religion and mythology 7 In history 8 See also 9 References 10 Further reading 11 External links Terminology Didactic model of a chicken. In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels.[9] Castrated roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens, and younger females as pullets,[10] although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[11] The young are often called chicks. \"Chicken\" originally referred to young domestic fowl.[12] The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of \"chicken\" survives in the phrase \"Hen and Chickens\", sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The word \"chicken\" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term \"hen\" for females being in wide circulation, and the term “rooster” for males being that most commonly used. In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.[13] General biology and habitat Anatomy of a chicken. In some breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen by his larger comb Chickens are omnivores.[14] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes or young mice.[15] The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[16] The world\u0027s oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.[17] Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen\u0027s. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male\u0027s legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A muff or beard is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken\u0027s face, giving the appearance of a beard. Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger. Behavior Social behaviour Hen with chicks, India. Hen with chicks, Portugal. Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a \"pecking order\", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[18] When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat. A rooster\u0027s crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[19] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[20] Courtship To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (\"a circle dance\"), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[21] The dance triggers a response in the hen[21] and when she responds to his \"call\", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence: 1. Male approaching the hen. 2. Male pre-copulatory waltzing. 3. Male waltzing. 4. Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate). 5. Male mounting. 6. Male treading with both feet on hen’s back. 7. Male tail bending (following successful copulation).[22] Nesting and laying behaviour Chicken eggs vary in colour depending on the hen, typically ranging from bright white to shades of brown and even blue, green, and recently reported purple (found in South Asia) (Araucana varieties). Chicks before their first outing Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.[23] Broodiness Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to \"go broody\". The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will \"sit\" or \"set\" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe. While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest. To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor. Skull of a three-week-old chicken.

Breeds artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation. However, other breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species—even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as quail, pheasants, turkeys or geese. Hatching and early life Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.[21] Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so. Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by \"pipping\"; pecking a breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side. The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell). The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid. The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet down dries out in the warmth of the nest. Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac. Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.[24] Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night. She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old. Embryology Play media Earliest gestation stages and blood circulation of a chicken embryo In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds \"turned on\" a chicken recessive gene, talpid2, and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils. John Fallon, the overseer of the project, stated that chickens have \"...retained the ability to make teeth, under certain conditions... .\"[25] Breeding Origins Male red junglefowl. The domestic chicken is descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and is scientifically classified as the same species.[26] As such, it can and does freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[26] Recent genetic analysis has revealed that at least the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[27] The traditional view is that chickens were first domesticated for cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe.[2] In the last decade, there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins. According to one early study, a single domestication event which took place in what now is the country of Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[28] However, that study was later found to be based on incomplete data, and recent studies point to multiple maternal origins, with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, originating from the Indian subcontinent, where a large number of unique haplotypes occur.[29][30] It is postulated that the red junglefowl, known as the bamboo fowl in many Southeast Asian languages, is a special bird well-adapted to take advantage of the large amounts of fruits that are produced during the end of the 50-year bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.[31] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl when exposed to large amounts of food.[32] It has been claimed (based on paleoclimatic assumptions) that chickens were domesticated in Southern China in 6000 BC.[33] However, a recent study[34] raises doubts as to whether those birds were the ancestors of chickens today. Instead, the origin could be the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley. Eventually, the chicken moved to the Tarim basin of central Asia. The chicken reached Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine) about 3000 BC.[35] Introduction into Western Europe came far later, about the 1st millennium BC. Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia. Breeding increased under the Roman Empire, and was reduced in the Middle Ages.[35] Genetic sequencing of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the High Middle Ages chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.[36] Middle East traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC, in Syria; chickens went southward only in the 1st millennium BC. They reached Egypt for purposes of cockfighting about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in Ptolemaic Egypt (about 300 BC).[35] Little is known about the chicken\u0027s introduction into Africa. It was during the Hellenistic period (4th-2nd centuries BC), in the Southern Levant, that chickens began widely to be domesticated for food.[3] This change occurred at least 100 years before domestication of chickens spread to Europe. Three possible routes of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.[35] Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.[35] A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area.[35] South America An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the araucana, bred in southern Chile by the Mapuche people. Araucanas, some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears, lay blue-green eggs. It has long been suggested that they pre-date the arrival of European chickens brought by the Spanish and are evidence of pre-Columbian trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians, and South America. In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile. Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia.[37] These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus\u0027s arrival in the Americas.[38] However, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded: A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.[39] Use by humans Farming Main articles: Poultry farming and Chicken as food A former battery hen, five days after release. Note the pale comb - the comb may be a reliable indicator of health or vigor.[40] More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs.[41] In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat,[42] and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.[43] The vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farms. According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74 percent of the world\u0027s poultry meat and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.[44] An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming. Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of ethical consumerism. Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane.[45] Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities.[46] Reared for meat Main article: Broiler A commercial chicken house with open sides raising broiler pullets for meat Chickens farmed for meat are called broilers. Chickens will naturally live for six or more years, but broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size.[47] A free range or organic broiler will usually be slaughtered at about 14 weeks of age. Reared for eggs Main article: Egg as food Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens. In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day.[48] Some hen breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year, with \"the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days\".[49] After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen\u0027s egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable. Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years.[50] In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as \"soup hens\".[50] In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted, rather than being slaughtered, to re-invigorate egg-laying. This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7–14 days[51] or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%,[52] or up to 28 days under experimental conditions.[53] This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also re-invigorates egg-production. Some flocks may be force-moulted several times. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US.[54] As pets Main article: Chickens as pets Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent birds, and many find their behaviour entertaining.[55] Certain breeds, such as Silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.[56] Artificial incubation An egg incubator Incubation can successfully occur artificially in machines that provide the correct, controlled environment for the developing chick.[57][58] The average incubation period for chickens is 21 days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator. Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1 °C (1.8 °F) from the optimum temperature of 37.5 °C (99.5 °F) will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. Relative humidity should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren\u0027t turned, the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation. Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp. Diseases and ailments Chickens are susceptible to several parasites, including lice, mites, ticks, fleas, and intestinal worms, as well as other diseases. Despite the name, they are not affected by chickenpox, which is generally restricted to humans.[59] Some of the diseases that can affect chickens are shown below: Name Common name Cause Aspergillosis Aspergillus fungi Avian influenza bird flu virus Histomoniasis blackhead disease Histomonas meleagridis Botulism paralysis Clostridium botulinum toxin Cage layer fatigue mineral deficiency, lack of physical exercise Campylobacteriosis tissue injury in the gut Coccidiosis Coccidia Colds virus Crop bound improper feeding Dermanyssus gallinae red mite parasite Egg binding oversized egg Erysipelas Streptococcus bacteria Fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome high-energy food Fowl cholera Pasteurella multocida Fowlpox Fowlpox virus Fowl typhoid bacteria Gallid herpesvirus 1 infectious laryngotracheitis virus Gapeworm Syngamus trachea worms Infectious bronchitis Infectious Bronchitis Virus Infectious bursal disease Gumboro infectious bursal disease virus Infectious coryza in chickens Avibacterium paragallinarum Lymphoid leukosis Avian sarcoma leukosis virus Marek\u0027s disease Gallid herpesvirus 2 Moniliasis yeast infection or thrush Candida fungi Mycoplasma bacteria Newcastle disease Avian avulavirus 1 Necrotic enteritis bacteria Omphalitis Mushy chick disease[60] bacteria Peritonitis[61] infection in abdomen from egg yolk Psittacosis Chlamydia psittaci Pullorum Salmonella bacteria Scaly leg Cnemidocoptes mutans Squamous cell carcinoma cancer Tibial dyschondroplasia speed growing Toxoplasmosis Toxoplasma gondii Ulcerative enteritis bacteria Ulcerative pododermatitis bumblefoot bacteria In religion and mythology Vatican Persian Cock — A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian cock or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican (Holy See) in Rome dating to 600 CE. Notice the halo denoting the status of being holy in that religious schema. Since antiquity chickens have been, and still are, a sacred animal in some cultures[62] and deeply embedded within belief systems and religious worship. The term \"Persian bird\" for the rooster appears to have been given by the Greeks after Persian contact \"because of his great importance and his religious use among the Persians\".[63] In Indonesia the chicken has great significance during the Hindu cremation ceremony. A chicken is considered a channel for evil spirits which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life. In ancient Greece, the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of Ares, Heracles, and Athena. The alleged last words of Socrates as he died from hemlock poisoning, as recounted by Plato, were \"Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt?\", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life. The Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters. Several of Aesop\u0027s Fables reference this belief. In the New Testament, Jesus prophesied the betrayal by Peter: \"Jesus answered, \u0027I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.\u0027\"[64] It happened,[65] and Peter cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal. Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about Jerusalem: \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.\"[66] In the sixth century, Pope Gregory I declared the rooster the emblem of Christianity[67] and another Papal enactment of the ninth century by Pope Nicholas I[62] ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeple.[68] In many Central European folk tales, the devil is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster. In traditional Jewish practice, a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called kapparos; it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move it around the head. A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person\u0027s sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God\u0027s hands. The Talmud speaks of learning \"courtesy toward one\u0027s mate\" from the rooster.[69] This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first. A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked. The Talmud likewise provides us with the statement \"Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks\",[70][71] which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of \"a girt one of the loins\" (Young\u0027s Literal Translation) that which is \"stately in his stride\" and \"move with stately bearing\" in the Book of Proverbs 30:29-31 as referenced by Michael V. Fox in his Proverbs 10-31 where Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon (Saadia Gaon) identifies the definitive trait of \"A cock girded about the loins\" in Proverbs 30:31 (Douay–Rheims Bible) as \"the honesty of their behavior and their success\",[72] identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use. The chicken is one of the symbols of the Chinese Zodiac. In Chinese folk religion, a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the Buddha are not recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with \"serious\" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In Confucian Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g., sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken\u0027s head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However, this practice is rare today. A cockatrice was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a rooster\u0027s call. In history The red junglefowl An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages). Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture,[73] the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.[74] The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.[75][76] The poet Cratinus (mid-5th century BC, according to the later Greek author Athenaeus) calls the chicken \"the Persian alarm\". In Aristophanes\u0027s comedy The Birds (414 BC) a chicken is called \"the Median bird\", which points to an introduction from the East. Pictures of chickens are found on Greek red figure and black-figure pottery. In ancient Greece, chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for symposia.[77] Delos seems to have been a center of chicken breeding (Columella, De Re Rustica 8.3.4). \"About 3200 BC chickens were common in Sindh. After the attacks of Aria people these fowls spred from Sindh to Balakh and Iran. During attacks and wars between Iranian and Greeks the chickens of Hellanic breed came in Iran and about 1000 BC Hellanic chickens came into Sindh through Medan\".[78] The Romans used chickens for oracles, both when flying (\"ex avibus\", Augury) and when feeding (\"auspicium ex tripudiis\", Alectryomancy). The hen (\"gallina\") gave a favourable omen (\"auspicium ratum\"), when appearing from the left (Cic., de Div. ii.26), like the crow and the owl. For the oracle \"ex tripudiis\" according to Cicero (Cic. de Div. ii.34), any bird could be used in auspice, and shows at one point that any bird could perform the tripudium[79] but normally only chickens (\"pulli\") were consulted. The chickens were cared for by the pullarius, who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was needed. If the chickens stayed in their cage, made noises (\"occinerent\"), beat their wings or flew away, the omen was bad; if they ate greedily, the omen was good.[80] In 249 BC, the Roman general Publius Claudius Pulcher had his \"sacred chickens\" \"[81] thrown overboard when they refused to feed before the battle of Drepana, saying \"If they won\u0027t eat, perhaps they will drink.\" He promptly lost the battle against the Carthaginians and 93 Roman ships were sunk. Back in Rome, he was tried for impiety and heavily fined.[82] In 162 BC, the Lex Faunia forbade fattening hens to conserve grain rations.[83][84] To get around this, the Romans castrated roosters (capon), which resulted in a doubling of size[85] despite the law that was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens. It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet Apicius offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the stomach, liver, testicles and even the pygostyle (the fatty \"tail\" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach). The Roman author Columella gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, De Re Rustica (On Agriculture). He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for cockfighting by the Greeks (De Re Rustica 8.3.4). For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (De Re Rustica 8.2.13). Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages. According to Columella (De Re Rustica 8.2.7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (De Re Rustica 8.5.11). Columella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and \"poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke\" (De Re Rustica 8.3.1).[86] Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth. Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths. According to Columella (De Re Rustica 8.4.1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (Lolium sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the winter solstice, in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily. Columella[87] advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, those that aren\u0027t productive or are poor care-takers of their eggs, and particularly those that eat their own and other hens\u0027 eggs. According to Aldrovandi, capons were produced by burning \"the hind part of the bowels, or loins or spurs\"[88] with a hot iron. The wound was treated with potter\u0027s chalk. For the use of poultry and eggs in the kitchens of ancient Rome see Roman eating and drinking. Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans). They were housed in extremely solid chicken coops built from stone, which was first reported as such to Linton Palmer in 1868, who also \"expressed his doubts about this\".[89] See also Chicken portal Poultry portal Abnormal behaviour of birds in captivity Battery Hen Welfare Trust, a UK charity for laying hens Chicken eyeglasses Chicken fat Chicken hypnotism Chicken or the egg Chicken manure Chook raffle – a type of raffle where the prize is a chicken.

For the broader species of which chickens form a subspecies, see Red junglefowl. For other uses, see Chicken (disambiguation) and Chooks (disambiguation). Chicken A rooster or cock (left) and hen (right) Conservation status Domesticated Scientific classification Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Aves Order: Galliformes Family: Phasianidae Genus: Gallus Species: G. gallus Subspecies: G. g. domesticus Trinomial name Gallus gallus domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758) The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[1] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast Asia, East Asia,[4] and South Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[5] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the \"bird that gives birth every day\" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[6][7][8] Contents 1 Terminology 2 General biology and habitat 2.1 Behavior 2.1.1 Social behaviour 2.1.2 Courtship 2.1.3 Nesting and laying behaviour 2.1.4 Broodiness 2.1.5 Hatching and early life 2.2 Embryology 3 Breeding 3.1 Origins 3.1.1 South America 4 Use by humans 4.1 Farming 4.1.1 Reared for meat 4.1.2 Reared for eggs 4.2 As pets 4.3 Artificial incubation 5 Diseases and ailments 6 In religion and mythology 7 In history 8 See also 9 References 10 Further reading 11 External links Terminology Didactic model of a chicken. In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels.[9] Castrated roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens, and younger females as pullets,[10] although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[11] The young are often called chicks. \"Chicken\" originally referred to young domestic fowl.[12] The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of \"chicken\" survives in the phrase \"Hen and Chickens\", sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The word \"chicken\" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term \"hen\" for females being in wide circulation, and the term “rooster” for males being that most commonly used. In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.[13] General biology and habitat Anatomy of a chicken. In some breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen by his larger comb Chickens are omnivores.[14] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes or young mice.[15] The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[16] The world\u0027s oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.[17] Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen\u0027s. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male\u0027s legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A muff or beard is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken\u0027s face, giving the appearance of a beard. Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger. Behavior Social behaviour Hen with chicks, India. Hen with chicks, Portugal. Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a \"pecking order\", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[18] When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat. A rooster\u0027s crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[19] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[20] Courtship To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (\"a circle dance\"), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[21] The dance triggers a response in the hen[21] and when she responds to his \"call\", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence: 1. Male approaching the hen. 2. Male pre-copulatory waltzing. 3. Male waltzing. 4. Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate). 5. Male mounting. 6. Male treading with both feet on hen’s back. 7. Male tail bending (following successful copulation).[22] Nesting and laying behaviour Chicken eggs vary in colour depending on the hen, typically ranging from bright white to shades of brown and even blue, green, and recently reported purple (found in South Asia) (Araucana varieties). Chicks before their first outing Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.[23] Broodiness Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to \"go broody\". The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will \"sit\" or \"set\" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe. While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest. To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor. Skull of a three-week-old chicken.

Breeds artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation. However, other breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species—even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as quail, pheasants, turkeys or geese. Hatching and early life Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.[21] Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so. Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by \"pipping\"; pecking a breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side. The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell). The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid. The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet down dries out in the warmth of the nest. Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac. Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.[24] Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night. She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old. Embryology Play media Earliest gestation stages and blood circulation of a chicken embryo In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds \"turned on\" a chicken recessive gene, talpid2, and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils. John Fallon, the overseer of the project, stated that chickens have \"...retained the ability to make teeth, under certain conditions... .\"[25] Breeding Origins Male red junglefowl. The domestic chicken is descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and is scientifically classified as the same species.[26] As such, it can and does freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[26] Recent genetic analysis has revealed that at least the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[27] The traditional view is that chickens were first domesticated for cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe.[2] In the last decade, there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins. According to one early study, a single domestication event which took place in what now is the country of Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[28] However, that study was later found to be based on incomplete data, and recent studies point to multiple maternal origins, with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, originating from the Indian subcontinent, where a large number of unique haplotypes occur.[29][30] It is postulated that the red junglefowl, known as the bamboo fowl in many Southeast Asian languages, is a special bird well-adapted to take advantage of the large amounts of fruits that are produced during the end of the 50-year bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.[31] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl when exposed to large amounts of food.[32] It has been claimed (based on paleoclimatic assumptions) that chickens were domesticated in Southern China in 6000 BC.[33] However, a recent study[34] raises doubts as to whether those birds were the ancestors of chickens today. Instead, the origin could be the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley. Eventually, the chicken moved to the Tarim basin of central Asia. The chicken reached Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine) about 3000 BC.[35] Introduction into Western Europe came far later, about the 1st millennium BC. Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia. Breeding increased under the Roman Empire, and was reduced in the Middle Ages.[35] Genetic sequencing of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the High Middle Ages chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.[36] Middle East traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC, in Syria; chickens went southward only in the 1st millennium BC. They reached Egypt for purposes of cockfighting about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in Ptolemaic Egypt (about 300 BC).[35] Little is known about the chicken\u0027s introduction into Africa. It was during the Hellenistic period (4th-2nd centuries BC), in the Southern Levant, that chickens began widely to be domesticated for food.[3] This change occurred at least 100 years before domestication of chickens spread to Europe. Three possible routes of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.[35] Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.[35] A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area.[35] South America An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the araucana, bred in southern Chile by the Mapuche people. Araucanas, some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears, lay blue-green eggs. It has long been suggested that they pre-date the arrival of European chickens brought by the Spanish and are evidence of pre-Columbian trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians, and South America. In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile. Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia.[37] These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus\u0027s arrival in the Americas.[38] However, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded: A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.[39] Use by humans Farming Main articles: Poultry farming and Chicken as food A former battery hen, five days after release. Note the pale comb - the comb may be a reliable indicator of health or vigor.[40] More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs.[41] In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat,[42] and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.[43] The vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farms. According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74 percent of the world\u0027s poultry meat and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.[44] An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming. Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of ethical consumerism. Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane.[45] Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities.[46] Reared for meat Main article: Broiler A commercial chicken house with open sides raising broiler pullets for meat Chickens farmed for meat are called broilers. Chickens will naturally live for six or more years, but broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size.[47] A free range or organic broiler will usually be slaughtered at about 14 weeks of age. Reared for eggs Main article: Egg as food Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens. In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day.[48] Some hen breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year, with \"the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days\".[49] After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen\u0027s egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable. Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years.[50] In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as \"soup hens\".[50] In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted, rather than being slaughtered, to re-invigorate egg-laying. This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7–14 days[51] or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%,[52] or up to 28 days under experimental conditions.[53] This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also re-invigorates egg-production. Some flocks may be force-moulted several times. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US.[54] As pets Main article: Chickens as pets Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent birds, and many find their behaviour entertaining.[55] Certain breeds, such as Silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.[56] Artificial incubation An egg incubator Incubation can successfully occur artificially in machines that provide the correct, controlled environment for the developing chick.[57][58] The average incubation period for chickens is 21 days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator. Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1 °C (1.8 °F) from the optimum temperature of 37.5 °C (99.5 °F) will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. Relative humidity should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren\u0027t turned, the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation. Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp. Diseases and ailments Chickens are susceptible to several parasites, including lice, mites, ticks, fleas, and intestinal worms, as well as other diseases. Despite the name, they are not affected by chickenpox, which is generally restricted to humans.[59] Some of the diseases that can affect chickens are shown below: Name Common name Cause Aspergillosis Aspergillus fungi Avian influenza bird flu virus Histomoniasis blackhead disease Histomonas meleagridis Botulism paralysis Clostridium botulinum toxin Cage layer fatigue mineral deficiency, lack of physical exercise Campylobacteriosis tissue injury in the gut Coccidiosis Coccidia Colds virus Crop bound improper feeding Dermanyssus gallinae red mite parasite Egg binding oversized egg Erysipelas Streptococcus bacteria Fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome high-energy food Fowl cholera Pasteurella multocida Fowlpox Fowlpox virus Fowl typhoid bacteria Gallid herpesvirus 1 infectious laryngotracheitis virus Gapeworm Syngamus trachea worms Infectious bronchitis Infectious Bronchitis Virus Infectious bursal disease Gumboro infectious bursal disease virus Infectious coryza in chickens Avibacterium paragallinarum Lymphoid leukosis Avian sarcoma leukosis virus Marek\u0027s disease Gallid herpesvirus 2 Moniliasis yeast infection or thrush Candida fungi Mycoplasma bacteria Newcastle disease Avian avulavirus 1 Necrotic enteritis bacteria Omphalitis Mushy chick disease[60] bacteria Peritonitis[61] infection in abdomen from egg yolk Psittacosis Chlamydia psittaci Pullorum Salmonella bacteria Scaly leg Cnemidocoptes mutans Squamous cell carcinoma cancer Tibial dyschondroplasia speed growing Toxoplasmosis Toxoplasma gondii Ulcerative enteritis bacteria Ulcerative pododermatitis bumblefoot bacteria In religion and mythology Vatican Persian Cock — A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian cock or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican (Holy See) in Rome dating to 600 CE. Notice the halo denoting the status of being holy in that religious schema. Since antiquity chickens have been, and still are, a sacred animal in some cultures[62] and deeply embedded within belief systems and religious worship. The term \"Persian bird\" for the rooster appears to have been given by the Greeks after Persian contact \"because of his great importance and his religious use among the Persians\".[63] In Indonesia the chicken has great significance during the Hindu cremation ceremony. A chicken is considered a channel for evil spirits which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life. In ancient Greece, the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of Ares, Heracles, and Athena. The alleged last words of Socrates as he died from hemlock poisoning, as recounted by Plato, were \"Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt?\", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life. The Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters. Several of Aesop\u0027s Fables reference this belief. In the New Testament, Jesus prophesied the betrayal by Peter: \"Jesus answered, \u0027I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.\u0027\"[64] It happened,[65] and Peter cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal. Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about Jerusalem: \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.\"[66] In the sixth century, Pope Gregory I declared the rooster the emblem of Christianity[67] and another Papal enactment of the ninth century by Pope Nicholas I[62] ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeple.[68] In many Central European folk tales, the devil is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster. In traditional Jewish practice, a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called kapparos; it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move it around the head. A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person\u0027s sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God\u0027s hands. The Talmud speaks of learning \"courtesy toward one\u0027s mate\" from the rooster.[69] This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first. A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked. The Talmud likewise provides us with the statement \"Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks\",[70][71] which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of \"a girt one of the loins\" (Young\u0027s Literal Translation) that which is \"stately in his stride\" and \"move with stately bearing\" in the Book of Proverbs 30:29-31 as referenced by Michael V. Fox in his Proverbs 10-31 where Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon (Saadia Gaon) identifies the definitive trait of \"A cock girded about the loins\" in Proverbs 30:31 (Douay–Rheims Bible) as \"the honesty of their behavior and their success\",[72] identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use. The chicken is one of the symbols of the Chinese Zodiac. In Chinese folk religion, a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the Buddha are not recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with \"serious\" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In Confucian Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g., sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken\u0027s head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However, this practice is rare today. A cockatrice was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a rooster\u0027s call. In history The red junglefowl An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages). Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture,[73] the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.[74] The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.[75][76] The poet Cratinus (mid-5th century BC, according to the later Greek author Athenaeus) calls the chicken \"the Persian alarm\". In Aristophanes\u0027s comedy The Birds (414 BC) a chicken is called \"the Median bird\", which points to an introduction from the East. Pictures of chickens are found on Greek red figure and black-figure pottery. In ancient Greece, chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for symposia.[77] Delos seems to have been a center of chicken breeding (Columella, De Re Rustica 8.3.4). \"About 3200 BC chickens were common in Sindh. After the attacks of Aria people these fowls spred from Sindh to Balakh and Iran. During attacks and wars between Iranian and Greeks the chickens of Hellanic breed came in Iran and about 1000 BC Hellanic chickens came into Sindh through Medan\".[78] The Romans used chickens for oracles, both when flying (\"ex avibus\", Augury) and when feeding (\"auspicium ex tripudiis\", Alectryomancy). The hen (\"gallina\") gave a favourable omen (\"auspicium ratum\"), when appearing from the left (Cic., de Div. ii.26), like the crow and the owl. For the oracle \"ex tripudiis\" according to Cicero (Cic. de Div. ii.34), any bird could be used in auspice, and shows at one point that any bird could perform the tripudium[79] but normally only chickens (\"pulli\") were consulted. The chickens were cared for by the pullarius, who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was needed. If the chickens stayed in their cage, made noises (\"occinerent\"), beat their wings or flew away, the omen was bad; if they ate greedily, the omen was good.[80] In 249 BC, the Roman general Publius Claudius Pulcher had his \"sacred chickens\" \"[81] thrown overboard when they refused to feed before the battle of Drepana, saying \"If they won\u0027t eat, perhaps they will drink.\" He promptly lost the battle against the Carthaginians and 93 Roman ships were sunk. Back in Rome, he was tried for impiety and heavily fined.[82] In 162 BC, the Lex Faunia forbade fattening hens to conserve grain rations.[83][84] To get around this, the Romans castrated roosters (capon), which resulted in a doubling of size[85] despite the law that was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens. It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet Apicius offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the stomach, liver, testicles and even the pygostyle (the fatty \"tail\" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach). The Roman author Columella gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, De Re Rustica (On Agriculture). He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for cockfighting by the Greeks (De Re Rustica 8.3.4). For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (De Re Rustica 8.2.13). Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages. According to Columella (De Re Rustica 8.2.7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (De Re Rustica 8.5.11). Columella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and \"poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke\" (De Re Rustica 8.3.1).[86] Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth. Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths. According to Columella (De Re Rustica 8.4.1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (Lolium sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the winter solstice, in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily. Columella[87] advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, those that aren\u0027t productive or are poor care-takers of their eggs, and particularly those that eat their own and other hens\u0027 eggs. According to Aldrovandi, capons were produced by burning \"the hind part of the bowels, or loins or spurs\"[88] with a hot iron. The wound was treated with potter\u0027s chalk. For the use of poultry and eggs in the kitchens of ancient Rome see Roman eating and drinking. Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans). They were housed in extremely solid chicken coops built from stone, which was first reported as such to Linton Palmer in 1868, who also \"expressed his doubts about this\".[89] See also Chicken portal Poultry portal Abnormal behaviour of birds in captivity Battery Hen Welfare Trust, a UK charity for laying hens Chicken eyeglasses Chicken fat Chicken hypnotism Chicken or the egg Chicken manure Chook raffle – a type of raffle where the prize is a chicken.

For the broader species of which chickens form a subspecies, see Red junglefowl. For other uses, see Chicken (disambiguation) and Chooks (disambiguation). Chicken A rooster or cock (left) and hen (right) Conservation status Domesticated Scientific classification Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Aves Order: Galliformes Family: Phasianidae Genus: Gallus Species: G. gallus Subspecies: G. g. domesticus Trinomial name Gallus gallus domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758) The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[1] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast Asia, East Asia,[4] and South Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[5] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the \"bird that gives birth every day\" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[6][7][8] Contents 1 Terminology 2 General biology and habitat 2.1 Behavior 2.1.1 Social behaviour 2.1.2 Courtship 2.1.3 Nesting and laying behaviour 2.1.4 Broodiness 2.1.5 Hatching and early life 2.2 Embryology 3 Breeding 3.1 Origins 3.1.1 South America 4 Use by humans 4.1 Farming 4.1.1 Reared for meat 4.1.2 Reared for eggs 4.2 As pets 4.3 Artificial incubation 5 Diseases and ailments 6 In religion and mythology 7 In history 8 See also 9 References 10 Further reading 11 External links Terminology Didactic model of a chicken. In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels.[9] Castrated roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens, and younger females as pullets,[10] although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[11] The young are often called chicks. \"Chicken\" originally referred to young domestic fowl.[12] The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of \"chicken\" survives in the phrase \"Hen and Chickens\", sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The word \"chicken\" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term \"hen\" for females being in wide circulation, and the term “rooster” for males being that most commonly used. In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.[13] General biology and habitat Anatomy of a chicken. In some breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen by his larger comb Chickens are omnivores.[14] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes or young mice.[15] The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[16] The world\u0027s oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.[17] Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen\u0027s. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male\u0027s legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A muff or beard is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken\u0027s face, giving the appearance of a beard. Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger. Behavior Social behaviour Hen with chicks, India. Hen with chicks, Portugal. Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a \"pecking order\", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[18] When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat. A rooster\u0027s crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[19] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[20] Courtship To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (\"a circle dance\"), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[21] The dance triggers a response in the hen[21] and when she responds to his \"call\", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence: 1. Male approaching the hen. 2. Male pre-copulatory waltzing. 3. Male waltzing. 4. Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate). 5. Male mounting. 6. Male treading with both feet on hen’s back. 7. Male tail bending (following successful copulation).[22] Nesting and laying behaviour Chicken eggs vary in colour depending on the hen, typically ranging from bright white to shades of brown and even blue, green, and recently reported purple (found in South Asia) (Araucana varieties). Chicks before their first outing Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.[23] Broodiness Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to \"go broody\". The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will \"sit\" or \"set\" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe. While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest. To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor. Skull of a three-week-old chicken.

Breeds artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation. However, other breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species—even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as quail, pheasants, turkeys or geese. Hatching and early life Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.[21] Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so. Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by \"pipping\"; pecking a breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side. The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell). The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid. The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet down dries out in the warmth of the nest. Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac. Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.[24] Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night. She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old. Embryology Play media Earliest gestation stages and blood circulation of a chicken embryo In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds \"turned on\" a chicken recessive gene, talpid2, and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils. John Fallon, the overseer of the project, stated that chickens have \"...retained the ability to make teeth, under certain conditions... .\"[25] Breeding Origins Male red junglefowl. The domestic chicken is descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and is scientifically classified as the same species.[26] As such, it can and does freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[26] Recent genetic analysis has revealed that at least the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[27] The traditional view is that chickens were first domesticated for cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe.[2] In the last decade, there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins. According to one early study, a single domestication event which took place in what now is the country of Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[28] However, that study was later found to be based on incomplete data, and recent studies point to multiple maternal origins, with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, originating from the Indian subcontinent, where a large number of unique haplotypes occur.[29][30] It is postulated that the red junglefowl, known as the bamboo fowl in many Southeast Asian languages, is a special bird well-adapted to take advantage of the large amounts of fruits that are produced during the end of the 50-year bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.[31] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl when exposed to large amounts of food.[32] It has been claimed (based on paleoclimatic assumptions) that chickens were domesticated in Southern China in 6000 BC.[33] However, a recent study[34] raises doubts as to whether those birds were the ancestors of chickens today. Instead, the origin could be the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley. Eventually, the chicken moved to the Tarim basin of central Asia. The chicken reached Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine) about 3000 BC.[35] Introduction into Western Europe came far later, about the 1st millennium BC. Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia. Breeding increased under the Roman Empire, and was reduced in the Middle Ages.[35] Genetic sequencing of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the High Middle Ages chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.[36] Middle East traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC, in Syria; chickens went southward only in the 1st millennium BC. They reached Egypt for purposes of cockfighting about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in Ptolemaic Egypt (about 300 BC).[35] Little is known about the chicken\u0027s introduction into Africa. It was during the Hellenistic period (4th-2nd centuries BC), in the Southern Levant, that chickens began widely to be domesticated for food.[3] This change occurred at least 100 years before domestication of chickens spread to Europe. Three possible routes of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.[35] Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.[35] A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area.[35] South America An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the araucana, bred in southern Chile by the Mapuche people. Araucanas, some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears, lay blue-green eggs. It has long been suggested that they pre-date the arrival of European chickens brought by the Spanish and are evidence of pre-Columbian trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians, and South America. In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile. Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia.[37] These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus\u0027s arrival in the Americas.[38] However, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded: A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.[39] Use by humans Farming Main articles: Poultry farming and Chicken as food A former battery hen, five days after release. Note the pale comb - the comb may be a reliable indicator of health or vigor.[40] More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs.[41] In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat,[42] and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.[43] The vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farms. According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74 percent of the world\u0027s poultry meat and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.[44] An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming. Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of ethical consumerism. Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane.[45] Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities.[46] Reared for meat Main article: Broiler A commercial chicken house with open sides raising broiler pullets for meat Chickens farmed for meat are called broilers. Chickens will naturally live for six or more years, but broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size.[47] A free range or organic broiler will usually be slaughtered at about 14 weeks of age. Reared for eggs Main article: Egg as food Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens. In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day.[48] Some hen breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year, with \"the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days\".[49] After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen\u0027s egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable. Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years.[50] In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as \"soup hens\".[50] In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted, rather than being slaughtered, to re-invigorate egg-laying. This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7–14 days[51] or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%,[52] or up to 28 days under experimental conditions.[53] This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also re-invigorates egg-production. Some flocks may be force-moulted several times. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US.[54] As pets Main article: Chickens as pets Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent birds, and many find their behaviour entertaining.[55] Certain breeds, such as Silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.[56] Artificial incubation An egg incubator Incubation can successfully occur artificially in machines that provide the correct, controlled environment for the developing chick.[57][58] The average incubation period for chickens is 21 days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator. Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1 °C (1.8 °F) from the optimum temperature of 37.5 °C (99.5 °F) will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. Relative humidity should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren\u0027t turned, the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation. Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp. Diseases and ailments Chickens are susceptible to several parasites, including lice, mites, ticks, fleas, and intestinal worms, as well as other diseases. Despite the name, they are not affected by chickenpox, which is generally restricted to humans.[59] Some of the diseases that can affect chickens are shown below: Name Common name Cause Aspergillosis Aspergillus fungi Avian influenza bird flu virus Histomoniasis blackhead disease Histomonas meleagridis Botulism paralysis Clostridium botulinum toxin Cage layer fatigue mineral deficiency, lack of physical exercise Campylobacteriosis tissue injury in the gut Coccidiosis Coccidia Colds virus Crop bound improper feeding Dermanyssus gallinae red mite parasite Egg binding oversized egg Erysipelas Streptococcus bacteria Fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome high-energy food Fowl cholera Pasteurella multocida Fowlpox Fowlpox virus Fowl typhoid bacteria Gallid herpesvirus 1 infectious laryngotracheitis virus Gapeworm Syngamus trachea worms Infectious bronchitis Infectious Bronchitis Virus Infectious bursal disease Gumboro infectious bursal disease virus Infectious coryza in chickens Avibacterium paragallinarum Lymphoid leukosis Avian sarcoma leukosis virus Marek\u0027s disease Gallid herpesvirus 2 Moniliasis yeast infection or thrush Candida fungi Mycoplasma bacteria Newcastle disease Avian avulavirus 1 Necrotic enteritis bacteria Omphalitis Mushy chick disease[60] bacteria Peritonitis[61] infection in abdomen from egg yolk Psittacosis Chlamydia psittaci Pullorum Salmonella bacteria Scaly leg Cnemidocoptes mutans Squamous cell carcinoma cancer Tibial dyschondroplasia speed growing Toxoplasmosis Toxoplasma gondii Ulcerative enteritis bacteria Ulcerative pododermatitis bumblefoot bacteria In religion and mythology Vatican Persian Cock — A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian cock or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican (Holy See) in Rome dating to 600 CE. Notice the halo denoting the status of being holy in that religious schema. Since antiquity chickens have been, and still are, a sacred animal in some cultures[62] and deeply embedded within belief systems and religious worship. The term \"Persian bird\" for the rooster appears to have been given by the Greeks after Persian contact \"because of his great importance and his religious use among the Persians\".[63] In Indonesia the chicken has great significance during the Hindu cremation ceremony. A chicken is considered a channel for evil spirits which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life. In ancient Greece, the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of Ares, Heracles, and Athena. The alleged last words of Socrates as he died from hemlock poisoning, as recounted by Plato, were \"Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt?\", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life. The Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters. Several of Aesop\u0027s Fables reference this belief. In the New Testament, Jesus prophesied the betrayal by Peter: \"Jesus answered, \u0027I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.\u0027\"[64] It happened,[65] and Peter cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal. Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about Jerusalem: \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.\"[66] In the sixth century, Pope Gregory I declared the rooster the emblem of Christianity[67] and another Papal enactment of the ninth century by Pope Nicholas I[62] ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeple.[68] In many Central European folk tales, the devil is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster. In traditional Jewish practice, a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called kapparos; it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move it around the head. A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person\u0027s sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God\u0027s hands. The Talmud speaks of learning \"courtesy toward one\u0027s mate\" from the rooster.[69] This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first. A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked. The Talmud likewise provides us with the statement \"Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks\",[70][71] which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of \"a girt one of the loins\" (Young\u0027s Literal Translation) that which is \"stately in his stride\" and \"move with stately bearing\" in the Book of Proverbs 30:29-31 as referenced by Michael V. Fox in his Proverbs 10-31 where Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon (Saadia Gaon) identifies the definitive trait of \"A cock girded about the loins\" in Proverbs 30:31 (Douay–Rheims Bible) as \"the honesty of their behavior and their success\",[72] identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use. The chicken is one of the symbols of the Chinese Zodiac. In Chinese folk religion, a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the Buddha are not recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with \"serious\" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In Confucian Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g., sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken\u0027s head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However, this practice is rare today. A cockatrice was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a rooster\u0027s call. In history The red junglefowl An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian languages). Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita culture,[73] the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.[74] The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.[75][76] The poet Cratinus (mid-5th century BC, according to the later Greek author Athenaeus) calls the chicken \"the Persian alarm\". In Aristophanes\u0027s comedy The Birds (414 BC) a chicken is called \"the Median bird\", which points to an introduction from the East. Pictures of chickens are found on Greek red figure and black-figure pottery. In ancient Greece, chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for symposia.[77] Delos seems to have been a center of chicken breeding (Columella, De Re Rustica 8.3.4). \"About 3200 BC chickens were common in Sindh. After the attacks of Aria people these fowls spred from Sindh to Balakh and Iran. During attacks and wars between Iranian and Greeks the chickens of Hellanic breed came in Iran and about 1000 BC Hellanic chickens came into Sindh through Medan\".[78] The Romans used chickens for oracles, both when flying (\"ex avibus\", Augury) and when feeding (\"auspicium ex tripudiis\", Alectryomancy). The hen (\"gallina\") gave a favourable omen (\"auspicium ratum\"), when appearing from the left (Cic., de Div. ii.26), like the crow and the owl. For the oracle \"ex tripudiis\" according to Cicero (Cic. de Div. ii.34), any bird could be used in auspice, and shows at one point that any bird could perform the tripudium[79] but normally only chickens (\"pulli\") were consulted. The chickens were cared for by the pullarius, who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was needed. If the chickens stayed in their cage, made noises (\"occinerent\"), beat their wings or flew away, the omen was bad; if they ate greedily, the omen was good.[80] In 249 BC, the Roman general Publius Claudius Pulcher had his \"sacred chickens\" \"[81] thrown overboard when they refused to feed before the battle of Drepana, saying \"If they won\u0027t eat, perhaps they will drink.\" He promptly lost the battle against the Carthaginians and 93 Roman ships were sunk. Back in Rome, he was tried for impiety and heavily fined.[82] In 162 BC, the Lex Faunia forbade fattening hens to conserve grain rations.[83][84] To get around this, the Romans castrated roosters (capon), which resulted in a doubling of size[85] despite the law that was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens. It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet Apicius offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the stomach, liver, testicles and even the pygostyle (the fatty \"tail\" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach). The Roman author Columella gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, De Re Rustica (On Agriculture). He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for cockfighting by the Greeks (De Re Rustica 8.3.4). For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (De Re Rustica 8.2.13). Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages. According to Columella (De Re Rustica 8.2.7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (De Re Rustica 8.5.11). Columella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and \"poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke\" (De Re Rustica 8.3.1).[86] Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth. Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths. According to Columella (De Re Rustica 8.4.1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (Lolium sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the winter solstice, in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily. Columella[87] advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, those that aren\u0027t productive or are poor care-takers of their eggs, and particularly those that eat their own and other hens\u0027 eggs. According to Aldrovandi, capons were produced by burning \"the hind part of the bowels, or loins or spurs\"[88] with a hot iron. The wound was treated with potter\u0027s chalk. For the use of poultry and eggs in the kitchens of ancient Rome see Roman eating and drinking. Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans). They were housed in extremely solid chicken coops built from stone, which was first reported as such to Linton Palmer in 1868, who also \"expressed his doubts about this\".[89] See also Chicken portal Poultry portal Abnormal behaviour of birds in captivity Battery Hen Welfare Trust, a UK charity for laying hens Chicken eyeglasses Chicken fat Chicken hypnotism Chicken or the egg Chicken manure Chook raffle – a type of raffle where the prize is a chicken.

There are hundreds of chicken breeds in existence.[1] Domesticated for thousands of years, distinguishable breeds of chicken have been present since the combined factors of geographical isolation and selection for desired characteristics created regional types with distinct physical and behavioral traits passed on to their offspring. The physical traits used to distinguish chicken breeds are size, plumage color, comb type, skin color, number of toes, amount of feathering, egg color, and place of origin.[1] They are also roughly divided by primary use, whether for eggs, meat, or ornamental purposes, and with some considered to be dual-purpose.[1] In the 21st century, chickens are frequently bred according to predetermined breed standards set down by governing organizations. The first of such standards was the British Poultry Standard, which is still in publication today.[2][3] Other standards include the Standard of Perfection, the Australian Poultry Standard, and the standard of the American Bantam Association, which deals exclusively with bantam fowl.[3] Only some of the known breeds are included in these publications, and only those breeds are eligible to be shown competitively. There are additionally a few hybrid strains which are common in the poultry world, especially in large poultry farms. These types are first generation crosses of true breeds. Hybrids do not reliably pass on their features to their offspring, but are highly valued for their producing abilities.[1] Table of contents By place of origin: Afghanistan • Albania • Australia •

However, distinct breeds are the result of selective breeding to emphasize certain traits. Any breed may technically be used for general agricultural purposes, and all breeds are shown to some degree. But each chicken breed is known for a primary use. Eggs[edit] An Araucana Many breeds were selected and are used primarily for producing eggs, these are mostly light-weight birds whose hens do not go broody often. Ancona Andalusian Asturian Painted Hen Barnevelder Campine Catalana Easter Egger Egyptian Fayoumi Norwegian Jærhøne Kraienköppe (Twentse) Lakenvelder Leghorn Marans Minorca Orloff Penedesenca Sicilian Buttercup White-Faced Black Spanish Welsummer Meat[edit] Most farms and homesteads use dual-purpose breeds for meat production. Some breeds are raised mainly for meat: Bresse Cornish (a.k.a. Indian Game) Ixworth Jersey Giant Dual-purpose[edit] Barred Plymouth Rock, a dual-purpose breed The generalist breeds used in barnyards worldwide are adaptable utility birds good at producing both meat and eggs. Though some may be slightly better for one of these purposes, they are usually called dual-purpose breeds.

Many breeds have always been kept for ornamental purposes, and others have been shifted from their original use to become first and foremost exhibition fowl, even if they may retain some inherent utility. Since the sport of cockfighting has been outlawed in the developed world, most breeds first developed for this purpose, called game fowl, are now seen principally in the show ring rather than the cock pit as fighting cocks. Key U denotes a breed primarily used for exhibition, but which is still used for utility purposes. G denotes a game breed.

Miniatures are usually one-fifth to one-quarter the size of the standard breed, but they are expected to exhibit all of the standard breed\u0027s characteristics. A true bantam has no large counterpart, and is naturally small. The true bantams include: Belgian Bearded d\u0027Anvers Belgian Bearded d\u0027Uccle Belgian d\u0027Everberg Booted Bantam Dutch Bantam Japanese Bantam Nankin Pekin Rosecomb Sebright Serama Silkie Cross-breeds[edit] See also: Category:Chicken hybrids Many common strains of cross-bred chickens exist, but none breed true or are recognized by poultry breed standards. Thus, though they are extremely common in flocks focusing on high productivity, cross-breeds do not technically meet the definition of a breed. Most cross-breed strains are sex linked, allowing for easy chick sexing.

Broiler Distribution World-wide Use Meat Traits Skin color Yellow Classification Poultry A broiler (Gallus gallus domesticus) is any chicken that is bred and raised specifically for meat production.[1] Many typical broilers have white feathers and yellowish skin. Most commercial broilers reach slaughter-weight between four[2] and seven weeks of age, although slower growing breeds reach slaughter-weight at approximately 14 weeks of age. Because the meat broilers are this young at slaughter (roughly 500g), their behaviour and physiology are that of an immature bird. Due to extensive breeding selection for rapid early growth and the husbandry used to sustain this, broilers are susceptible to several welfare concerns, particularly skeletal malformation and dysfunction, skin and eye lesions, and congestive heart conditions. Management of ventilation, housing, stocking density and in-house procedures must be evaluated regularly to support good welfare of the flock. The breeding stock (broiler-breeders) grow to maturity and beyond but also have welfare issues related to the frustration of a high feeding motivation and beak trimming. Broilers are usually grown as mixed-sex flocks in large sheds under intensive conditions.

Pedigree breeding began around 1916.[3] Magazines for the poultry industry existed at this time.[3][4] A hybrid variety of chicken was produced from a cross of a male of a naturally double-breasted Cornish strain and a female of a tall, large-boned strain of white Plymouth Rocks.[5] This first attempt at a hybrid meat breed was introduced in the 1930s and became dominant in the 1960s. The original hybrid was plagued by problems of low fertility, slow growth and disease susceptibility. Modern broilers have become very different from the Cornish/Rock hybrid. As an example, Donald Shaver (originally a breeder of egg-production-breeds) began gathering breeding stock for a broiler program in 1950. Besides the breeds normally favoured, Cornish Game, Plymouth Rock, New Hampshire, Langshans[disambiguation needed], Jersey Black Giant and Brahmas were included. A white feathered female line was purchased from Cobb. A full scale breeding program was commenced in 1958, with commercial shipments in Canada and the US in 1959 and in Europe in 1963.[6] As a second example, colour sexing broilers was proposed by Shaver in 1973. The genetics were based on the company\u0027s breeding plan for egg-layers which had been developed in the mid-1960s. A difficulty facing the breeders of the colour-sexed broiler is that the chicken must be white-feathered by slaughter age. After 12 years, accurate colour sexing without compromising economic traits was achieved.[6] Artificial insemination[edit] Artificial insemination is a mechanism in which spermatozoa are deposited into the reproductive tract of a female.[7] Artificial insemination provides a number of benefits relating to reproduction in the poultry industry. Broiler breeds have been selected specifically for growth, causing them to develop large pectoral muscles, which interfere with and reduce natural mating.[8] The amount of sperm produced and deposited in the hen’s reproductive tract may be limited because of this. Additionally, the males overall sex drive may be significantly reduced due to growth selection.[9] Artificial insemination has also allowed many farmers to incorporate selected genes into their stock, increasing their genetic quality[10] Abdominal massage is the most common method used for semen collection.[8] During this process, the rooster is restrained and the back region located towards the tail and behind the wings is caressed. This is done gently but quickly. Within a short period of time, the male should get an erection of the phallus. Once this occurs, the cloaca is squeezed and semen is collected from the external papilla of the vas deferens[11] During artificial insemination, semen is most frequently deposited intra-vaginally by means of a plastic syringe. In order for semen to be deposited here, the vaginal orifice is everted through the cloaca. This is simply done by applying pressure to the abdomen of the hen. The semen-containing instrument is placed 2–4 cm into the vaginal orifice. As the semen is being deposited, the pressure applied to the hen’s abdomen is being released simultaneously.[8] The individual performing this procedure typically uses one hand to move and direct the tail feathers, while using the other hand to insert the instrument and semen into the vagina.[11] General biology[edit] Modern commercial broilers, for example, Cornish crosses and Cornish-Rocks[citation needed], are artificially selected and bred for large-scale, efficient meat production. They are noted for having very fast growth rates, a high feed conversion ratio, and low levels of activity. Modern commercial broilers are bred to reach a slaughter-weight of about 2 kg in only 35 to 49 days.[5][12][13] As a consequence, the behaviour and physiology of broilers reared for meat are those of immature birds, rather than adults. Slow growing free-range and organic strains have been developed which reach slaughter-weight at 12 to 16 weeks of age. Typical broilers have white feathers and yellowish skin. Recent genetic analysis has revealed that the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[14] Modern crosses are also favorable for meat production because they lack the typical \"hair\" which many breeds have that must be removed by singeing after plucking the carcass. Both male and female broilers are reared for their meat. Behaviour[edit] Broiler behaviour is modified by the environment, and alters as the broilers’ age and bodyweight rapidly increase. For example, the activity of broilers reared outdoors is initially greater than broilers reared indoors, but from six weeks of age, decreases to comparable levels in all groups.[15] The same study shows that in the outdoors group, surprisingly little use is made of the extra space and facilities such as perches – it was proposed that the main reason for this was leg weakness as 80 per cent of the birds had a detectable gait abnormality at seven weeks of age. There is no evidence of reduced motivation to extend the behavioural repertoire, as, for example, ground pecking remained at significantly higher levels in the outdoor groups because this behaviour could also be performed from a lying posture rather than standing. Examining the frequency of all sexual behaviour shows a large decrease with age, suggestive of a decline in libido. The decline in libido is not enough to account for reduced fertility in heavy cocks at 58 weeks and is probably a consequence of the large bulk or the conformation of the males at this age interfering in some way with the transfer of semen during copulations which otherwise look normal.[16] Feeding and feed conversion[edit] Chickens are omnivores and modern broilers are given access to a special diet of high protein feed, usually delivered via an automated feeding system. This is combined with artificial lighting conditions to stimulate eating and growth and thus the desired body weight. In the U.S. in 2011, the average feed conversion ratio of a broiler was 1.91 pounds of feed per pound of liveweight. In 1925 the figure was 4.70.[17] Canada has a typical FCR of 1.72.[18] New Zealand commercial broiler farms have recorded the world\u0027s best broiler chicken FCR, consistently at 1.38 or lower.[19] Welfare issues[edit] Meat birds[edit] One-day old chicks arriving to be unpacked and placed in shed. Young birds being reared in a closed broiler house. Artificial selection has led to a great increase in the speed with which broilers develop and reach slaughter-weight. The time required to reach 1.5 kg live-weight decreased from 120 days to 30 days between 1925 and 2005. Selection for fast early growth-rate, and feeding and management procedures to support such growth, have led to various welfare problems in modern broiler strains.[20] Welfare of broilers is of particular concern given the large number of individuals that are produced; for example, the U.S. in 2011 produced approximately 9 billion broiler chickens.[21] Cardiovascular dysfunction[edit] Selection and husbandry for very fast growth means there is a genetically induced mismatch between the energy-supplying organs of the broiler and its energy-consuming organs.[13] Rapid growth can lead to metabolic disorders such as sudden death syndrome (SDS) and ascites.[20] SDS is an acute heart failure disease that affects mainly male fast-growing broilers which appear to be in good condition. Affected birds suddenly start to flap their wings, lose their balance, sometimes cry out and then fall on their backs or sides and die, usually all within a minute. In 1993, U.K. broiler producers reported an incidence of 0.8%. In 2000, SDS has a death rate of 0.1% to 3% in Europe.[13] Ascites is characterised by hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart, changes in liver function, pulmonary insufficiency, hypoxaemia and accumulation of large amounts of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Ascites develops gradually and the birds suffer for an extended period before they die. In the UK, up to 19 million broilers die in their sheds from heart failure each year.[22] Skeletal dysfunction[edit] Breeding for increased breast muscle means that the broilers’ centre of gravity has moved forward and their breasts are broader compared with their ancestors, which affects the way they walk and puts additional stresses on their hips and legs.[13] There is a high frequency of skeletal problems in broilers, mainly in the locomotory system, including varus and valgus deformities, osteodystrophy, dyschondroplasia and femoral head necrosis.[20] These leg abnormalities impair the locomotor abilities of the birds, and lame birds spend more time lying and sleeping.[23] The behavioural activities of broilers decrease rapidly from 14 days of age onwards.[24] Reduced locomotion also decreases ossification of the bones and results in skeletal abnormalities; these are reduced when broilers have been exercised under experimental conditions.[20] Most broilers find walking painful, as indicated by studies using analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs. In one experiment, healthy birds took 11 seconds to negotiate an obstacle course, whereas lame birds took 34 seconds. After the birds had been treated with carprofen, there was no effect on the speed of the healthy birds, however, the lame birds now took only 18 seconds to negotiate the course, indicating that the pain of lameness is relieved by the drug.[25] In self-selection experiments, lame birds select more drugged feed than non-lame birds[26] leading to the suggestion that leg problems in broilers are painful. Several research groups have developed \"gait scores\" (GS) to objectively rank the walking ability and lameness of broilers. In one example of these scales, GS\u003d0 indicates normal walking ability, GS\u003d3 indicates an obvious gait abnormality which affects the bird’s ability to move about and GS\u003d5 indicates a bird that cannot walk at all. GS\u003d5 birds tried to use their wings to help them walking, or crawled along on their shanks. In one study, almost 26% of the birds examined were rated as GS\u003d3 or above and can therefore be considered to have suffered from painful lameness.[13] Compassion in World Farming wrote on the incidence of leg problems in broilers: “ ...there is evidence that, far from improving, leg problems may have deteriorated further during the 1990s. Large and representative surveys of commercial broiler flocks in Denmark (1999) and Sweden (2002) found that in Denmark, 75% of the chickens had some walking abnormality and 30.1% were very lame (gait score greater than 2). In Sweden, over 72% of the chickens had some walking abnormality and around 20% were very lame. 36.9% of the chickens surveyed in Denmark and around half (46.4% and 52.6%, depending on strain) of the chickens surveyed in Sweden had leg deformities (varus/valgus). 57% of the chickens surveyed in Denmark and around half of the chickens surveyed in Sweden showed some evidence of tibial dychondroplasia (Sanotra, Berg and Lund, 2003).[13] ” The video recordings below are examples of broilers attempting to walk with increasing levels of gait abnormalities and therefore increasing gait scores.

This increased inactivity is linked with an increase in dermatitis caused by a greater amount of time in contact with ammonia in the litter. This contact dermatitis is characterised by hyperkeratosis and necrosis of the epidermis at the affected sites; it can take forms such as hock burns, breast blisters and foot pad lesions.[20] Stocking density[edit] Broilers in a rearing shed indicating the high stocking densities used. Broilers are usually kept at high stocking densities which vary considerably between countries. Typical stocking densities in Europe range between about 22 to 42 kg/m2 or between about 11 to 25 birds per square metre.[13] There is a reduction of feed intake and reduced growth rate when stocking density exceeds approximately 30 kg/m2 under deep litter conditions. The reduced growth rate is likely due to a reduced capacity to lose heat generated by metabolism. Higher stocking densities are associated with increased dermatitis including food pad lesions, breast blisters and soiled plumage.[20] In a large-scale experiment with commercial farms, it was shown that the management conditions (litter quality, temperature and humidity) were more important than stocking density.[27] Ocular dysfunction[edit] In attempts to improve or maintain fast growth, broilers are kept under a range of lighting conditions. These include continuous light (fluorescent and incandescent), continuous darkness, or under dim light; chickens kept under these light conditions develop eye abnormalities such as macrophthalmos, avian glaucoma, ocular enlargement and shallow anterior chambers.[28][29] Ammonia[edit] The litter in broiler pens can become highly polluted from the nitrogenous feces of the birds and produce ammonia. Ammonia has been shown to cause increased susceptibility to disease and other health-related problems such as Newcastle disease, airsaculitis and keratoconjunctivitis. The respiratory epithelium in birds is damaged by ammonia concentrations in the air exceeding 75 parts per million (ppm). Ammonia concentrations at 25 to 50 ppm induce eye lesions in broiler chicks after seven days of exposure.[29] Catching and transport[edit] Once the broilers have reached the target live-weight, they are caught, usually by hand, and packed live into crates for transport to the slaughterhouse. They are usually deprived of food and water for several hours before catching until slaughter. The process of catching, loading, transport and unloading causes serious stress, injury and even death to a large number of broilers. The number of broilers that died in the EU in 2005 during the process of catching, packing and transport was estimated to be as high as 18 to 35 million. In the UK, of broilers that were found to be ‘dead on arrival’ at the slaughterhouse in 2005, it was estimated that up to 40% may have died from thermal stress or suffocation due to crowding on the transporter.[13] Slaughter is done by hanging the birds fully conscious by their feet upside-down in shackles on a moving chain, stunning them by automatically immersing them in an electrified water bath and exsanguination by cutting their throats. Some research indicates that chickens might be more intelligent than previously supposed, which \"raises questions about how they are treated\". A possible 10-year life span has been shortened to six weeks for broilers.[30] Mortality rates[edit] According to historical records, broiler mortality rates are decreasing. In 1925, the mortality rate in the U.S. was 18% compared to 3.8% in 2011.[17] One indication of the effect of broilers\u0027 rapid growth rate on welfare is a comparison of the usual mortality rate for standard broiler chickens (1% per week) with that for slower-growing broiler chickens (0.25% per week) and with young laying hens (0.14% per week); the mortality rate of the fast-growing broilers is seven times the rate of laying hens (the same subspecies) of the same age.[13] Parent birds[edit] Meat broilers are usually slaughtered at approximately 35 to 49 days of age, well before they become sexually reproductive at 5 to 6 months of age. However, the bird\u0027s parents, often called \"broiler-breeders\", must live to maturity and beyond so they can be used for breeding. As a consequence, they have additional welfare concerns. Meat broilers have been artificially selected for an extremely high feeding motivation, but are not usually feed-restricted, as this would delay the time taken for them to reach slaughter-weight. Broiler-breeders have the same highly increased feeding motivation, but must be feed-restricted to prevent them becoming overweight with all its concomitant life-threatening problems. An experiment on broilers’ food intake found that 20% of birds allowed to eat as much as they wanted either died or had to be killed because of severe illness between 11 and 20 weeks of age – either they became so lame they could not stand or they developed cardiovascular problems.[13] Broiler breeders fed on commercial rations eat only a quarter to a half as much as they would with free access to food. They are highly motivated to eat at all times, presumably leading to chronic frustration of feeding.[31] Because broiler breeders live to adulthood, they might show feather pecking or other injurious pecking behaviour. To avoid this, they might be beak trimmed which can lead to acute or chronic pain. World production and consumption[edit] Consumption of broilers is surpassing that of beef in industrialized countries. Demand in Asia is rising.[32] A report in 2005 stated that around 5.9 billion broiler chickens for eating were produced yearly in the European Union. Mass production of chicken meat is a global industry and at that time, only two or three breeding companies supplied around 90% of the world’s breeder-broilers. The total number of meat chickens produced in the world was nearly 47 billion in 2004; of these, approximately 19% were produced in the US, 15% in China, 13% in the EU25 and 11% in Brazil.[13] Worldwide, 86.6 million tonnes of broiler meat will be produced in 2014.[33] Broiler industry[edit] Main article: Broiler industry The commercial production of broiler chickens for meat consumption is a highly industrialized process. There are two major sectors: (1) rearing birds intended for consumption and (2) rearing parent stock for breeding the meat birds.

For the nursery rhyme, see Cock a doodle doo. Wild rooster on the Hawaiian island of Kauai A rooster, also known as a cockerel or cock, is an adult male gallinaceous bird, usually an adult male chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus). Mature male chickens less than one year old are called cockerels. The term \"rooster\" originates in the United States,[1] and the term is widely used throughout North America, as well as Australia and New Zealand.[citation needed] The older terms \"cock\" or \"cockerel\", the latter denoting a young cock, are used in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[2] \"Roosting\" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at day, which is done by both sexes. The rooster is polygamous, but cannot guard several nests of eggs at once. He guards the general area where his hens are nesting, and attacks other roosters that enter his territory. During the daytime, a rooster often sits on a high perch, usually 0.9 to 1.5 m (3 to 5 feet) off the ground, to serve as a lookout for his group (hence the term \"rooster\"). He sounds a distinctive alarm call if predators are nearby and will frequently crow to assert his territory.

Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[3] The rooster is often portrayed as crowing at the break of dawn (\"cock-a-doodle-doo\"). However, while many roosters crow shortly after waking up, this idea is not exactly true. A rooster can and will crow at any time of the day. Some roosters are especially vociferous, crowing almost constantly, while others only crow a few times a day. These differences are dependent both upon the rooster\u0027s breed and individual personality. A rooster can often be seen sitting on fence posts or other objects, where he crows to proclaim his territory. Roosters have several other calls as well, and can cluck, similar to the hen. Roosters occasionally make a patterned series of clucks to attract hens to a source of food, the same way a mother hen does for her chicks. Rooster crowing contests[edit] Rooster crowing contests are a traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,[4] the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are held with longcrowers. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured. Capons[edit] Main article: Capon A capon is a castrated rooster. In the caponization procedure, the bird\u0027s testes are completely removed; a surgical procedure is required for this as the rooster\u0027s sexual organs are internal. As a result of this procedure, certain male physical characteristics will experience stunted development: The comb and wattles cease growing after castration, giving a capon\u0027s head a dwarfed appearance. The hackle, tail and saddle feathers grow unusually long. Caponization also affects the disposition of the bird. Removal of the bird\u0027s testes eliminates the male sex hormones, lessening the male sex instincts and changing their behaviour: the birds become more docile, less active, and tend not to fight. This procedure produces a unique type of poultry meat which is favoured by a specialized market. The meat of normal uncastrated roosters has a tendency to become coarse, stringy and tough as the birds age. This process does not occur in the capon. As caponized roosters grow more slowly than intact males, they accumulate more body fat. The concentration of fat in both the light and dark areas of the capon meat is greater than in that of the uncastrated males. Overall, it is often thought that capon meat is more tender, juicy, and flavorful than regular chicken. Cockfighting[edit] Main article: Cockfight A fighting cock for sale A cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two gamecocks or cocks, with the first use of the word gamecock (denoting use of the cock in game, sport, pastime or entertainment) appearing in 1646.[5] after the term \"cock of the game\" used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the secular sport of cockfighting in The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting in 1607. Gamecocks are not typical farm chickens. The cocks are specially bred and trained for increased stamina and strength. The comb and wattle are removed from a young gamecock because, if left intact, they would be a disadvantage during a match. This process is called dubbing. Sometimes the cocks are given drugs to increase their stamina or thicken their blood, which increases their chances of winning. Cockfighting is considered a traditional sporting event by some, and an example of animal cruelty by others and is therefore outlawed in most countries.[6] Usually wagers are made on the outcome of the match, with the surviving or last-bird-standing being declared the winner. There are religious significance and aspects of the rooster and the cockfight which are exampled by the religious belief of Tabuh Rah, a religious and spiritual cockfight where a rooster is used in religious custom by allowing him to fight against another rooster in the Balinese Hinduism spiritual appeasement exercise of Tabuh Rah, a form of animal sacrifice, where ritual fights usually take place outside the temple and follow an ancient and complex ritual as set out in the sacred lontar manuscripts.[7] Similarly within the religious schema of Christianity and the cockfight within a religious, spiritual and sacred context, there are numerous representations of the rooster or the cock and the cockfight as a religious vessel found in the Catacombs from the earliest period[8] as well as similar illustrations of cocks in fighting stance[9] taken from the Vivian Bible. The cockerel \"waltz\"[edit] Statue of a Rooster Cock at a park in South India The cockerel \"waltz\", when the cockerel struts in a half circle with one wing extended down, is an aggressive approach signifying to females his dominance, and usually, the female will submit by running or moving away from the cockerel in acknowledgement. On rare occasions, the hen will attempt to fight the cockerel for dominance. Once dominance is established, the cockerel will rarely waltz again. When other cockerels are in the hen yard, this waltz is used significantly more and most cockerels will waltz together if dominance has not been established; either one will back off, or the two cockerels will fight. Note also that the cockerel will waltz again if he is taken out of the pen for a period, usually 24 hours, and put back. Some more aggressive cockerels will drop and extend both wings and puff out all their body feathers to give the hens or other cocks the impression of a larger size, and charge through the hen yard. Religion and spiritual belief systems[edit] Rooster Since antiquity the rooster has been, and still is, a sacred animal in some cultures[10] and deeply embedded within various religious belief systems and religious worship. The term \"Persian bird\" for the cock would appear to have been given by the Greeks after Persian contact \"because of his great importance and his religious use among the Persians\",[11] but even long before that time, in Iran, during the Kianian Period, from about 2000 BC to about 700 BC, \"the cock was the most sacred\"[12] Animism, shamanism and tribal religions[edit] In Southeast Asia, understandings and interpretations of indigenous beliefs of the veneration of spirits and deities remain strong and for many who are practicing Christians there is still the veneration of the traditional spirits (anito) as in northern Philippines. Animist beliefs extend to the rooster and the cockfight, \"a popular form of fertility worship among almost all Southeast Asians\"[13] further considered by some within the Judeo-Christian ethic as a form of Baal or Baalim. Aluk or Aluk To Dolo a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma as a part of religion in Indonesia, within the Toraja society and the people of Tana Toraja, embrace religious rituals such as the funeral ceremony where a sacred cockfight is an integral part of the religious ceremony and considered sacred within that spiritual realm.[14] In several myths the cock has the power to revive the dead or to make a wish come true and is well known in Torajan cosmology.[15] Kaharingan, an animist folk religion of the Iban branch of the Dayak people, accepted as a form of Hinduism by the Indonesian government, includes the belief of a supreme deity as well as the rooster and cockfight in relation to that of the spiritual and religious and some with the belief that humans become the fighting cocks of god, with the Iban further believing the rooster and cockfight was introduced to them by god.[16] Gawai Dayak a festival of the Dayaks includes the cockfight and the waving of a rooster over offerings while asking for guidance and blessings with the rooster being sacrificed and the blood included in spiritual offering,[17] while the Tiwah festival involves the sacrifice of many animals including the chicken as offerings to the Supreme God.[18] Ikenga, an alusi of the Igbo people in southeastern Nigeria requires consecration before religious use with offerings which include the sacrificial blood of a rooster or ram for the spirit. Yoruba carved and painted wood tribal statue of a \"cock fight\" Miao (i.e. Hmong) are animists, shamanists and ancestor worshipers with beliefs being affected in varying degrees by Taoism, Buddhism and Christianity. At the Miao New Year there may be the sacrifice of domestic animals and there may be cockfights.[19] The Hmong of Southeast Guizhou will cover the rooster with a piece of red cloth and then hold it up to worship and sacrifice to the Heaven and the Earth. In Shamanism in the Hmong culture, a shaman may use a rooster in religious ceremony as it is said that the rooster shields the shaman from \"evil\" spirits by making him invisible as the evil spirits only see the rooster\u0027s spirit. In a 2010 trial of a Sheboygan Wisconsin Hmong who was charged with staging a cockfight, it was stated that the roosters were \"kept for both food and religious purposes\",[20] resulting in an acquittal.[21] In Viet Nam fighting roosters or fighting cocks are colloquially called \"sacred chickens\".[22] Santería which originated in Cuba from native Caribbean culture, Catholicism, and the Yoruba religion of West Africa \"ritually sacrifices chickens\".[10] Khasi people believe the rooster is sacrificed as a substitute for man, it being thought that the cock when sacrificed \"bears the sins of the man\"[23] (See also similarity of Kapport in Judaism) Yoruba oral history tells of God lowering Oduduwa down from the sky, the ancestor of all people, bringing with him a rooster, some dirt, and a palm seed. The dirt was thrown into the water and the cock scratched it to form land, and the seed grew into a tree with sixteen limbs, the original sixteen kingdoms.[24] \"The sacrifice of a cock and a ritual cockfight was part of the Imbolc festivities in honour of the pan-Celtic goddess Brighid\".[25] In the 20th century, Imbolc was resurrected as a religious festival in Neopaganism, specifically in Wicca, Neo-druidry and Celtic Reconstructionism.[26][27] Astro-mythology[edit] Rooster depicted It is understood that the constellations of the zodiac within the belief system of astrology, \"the religion of the stars\",[28] originated in the ancient land of Babylonia (including modern day Iraq). The lore of the True Shepherd of Anu (SIPA.ZI.AN.NA – Orion and his accompanying animal symbol, the Rooster, with both representing the herald of the gods, being their divinely ordained role to communicate messages of the gods.[29] \"The Heavenly Shepherd\" or \"True Shepherd of Anu\" – Anu being the chief god of the heavenly realms.[30] On the star map the figure of the Rooster was shown below and behind the figure of the True Shepherd, both representing the herald of the gods, in his bird and human forms respectively.[31] Nergal, an idol of the Assyrians, Babylonians, Phoenicians, and Persians, whose name means, \"a dunghill cock\".[31] (Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Brewer, 1900) Astrological mythology of the Assyrians and Babylonians was that the idol \"Nergal represents the planet Mars, which was ever the emblem of bloodshed\".[32] The Rooster is the tenth of the twelve animal symbols in the Chinese zodiac. It is suggested that the Pleiades are called the hens of Frigg or of Freya by Norse peoples.[33] That the three stars of Orion\u0027s belt was called the Distaff of Frigg seems undoubtable[34] -. See also Kukkuta Sastra in Divination. Norse mythology[edit] In Norse mythology, the crowing of three particular roosters occur at the beginning of the foretold events of Ragnarök. In the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá, references to Ragnarök begin from stanza 40 until 58, with the rest of the poem describing the aftermath. In the poem, a völva—a Nore seeress—recites information to the wisdom-seeking god Odin. In stanza 41, the völva says: Old Norse: Fylliz fiǫrvi feigra manna, rýðr ragna siǫt rauðom dreyra. Svǫrt verða sólskin of sumor eptir, veðr ǫll válynd. Vitoð ér enn, eða hvat?[35] English: It sates itself on the life-blood of fated men, paints red the powers\u0027 homes with crimson gore. Black become the sun\u0027s beams in the summers that follow, weathers all treacherous. Do you still seek to know? And what?[35] The völva then describes three roosters crowing: In stanza 42, the jötunn herdsman Eggthér sits on a mound and cheerfully plays his harp while the crimson rooster Fjalar (Old Norse \"hider, deceiver\"[36]) crows in the forest Gálgviðr. The golden rooster Gullinkambi crows to the Æsir in Valhalla, and the third, unnamed soot-red rooster crows in the halls of the underworld location of Hel in stanza 43.[37] The poem Fjölsvinnsmál also mentions a rooster by the name of Víðópnir.[38] According to the poem, the rooster sits atop the tree Mímameiðr, likely another name for the central cosmological tree Yggdrasil.[39] Buddhism[edit] Sacred Buddha amulet blessed in Wat Wangtakian Temple, Jorrakaepuek District, Kanjanaburee, Thailand Bayon Temple is an ancient Buddhist temple that also incorporates elements of Hindu cosmology includes \"a depiction of a cockfight\" within the walls of the temple.[40] which continues today within a debate of \"religious sanctity\"[41] With the rambling strutting roosters of the Buddhist temple of Wat Suwankhiri[42] on a Payathonsu cliff nearby, during April, Three Pagodas Pass becomes a site of the Songkran Festival with cockfights.[43] Sacred Buddhist amulets are made within that religious schema, created and blessed in various temples in Thailand, many depicting Buddha with cocks in fighting stance, sacred within that religion. The bird that symbolises greed in Tibetan Buddhist murals is sometimes said to be a cock. Divination[edit] Divination, a part of many religions is derived from the Latin divinare \"to foresee, to be inspired by a god\"[44][45] and as a part of divination comes alectryomancy, which means rooster and divination respectively, with the intent of communication between the gods and man in which the diviner observes a cock, pecking at grain, with Judaism forbidding acts of divination in the Hebrew Bible Deuteronomy 18:10-12. Alectormancy though is also sacrificing a sacred rooster, with the use of the sacred rooster through alectryomancy further understood within that religious character and likewise defined as the rooster fight or cockfight or cockfighting[46] with the intent of communication between the gods and man. Kukkuta Sastra (Cock Astrology) is a form of divination based on the rooster fight and commonly believed in coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh, India. It is prevalent in the state, especially in the districts of Krishna, Guntur, East Godavari and West Godavari and the Sankranti festival. Hinduism[edit] Main article: Hinduism Kartikeya with Vel and Seval (rooster), coin of the Yaudheya 200 BCE Hindu war god Karthikeya is depicted with a rooster on his flag. A demon Surapadman was split into two and the halves turned into the peacock (his mount) and the rooster in his flag. Balinese Hinduism includes the religious belief of Tabuh Rah, a religious cockfight where a rooster is used to fight against another rooster. The altar and deity Ida Ratu Saung may be seen with a fighting cock in his hand[47] with the spilling of blood being necessary as purification to appease the evil spirits. Ritual fights usually take place outside the temple proper and follow an ancient and complex ritual as set out in the sacred lontar manuscripts.[48] Likewise a popular Hindu ritual form of worship of North Malabar in Kerala, India is the blood offering to the Theyyam gods. Despite being forbidden in the Vedic philosophy of sattvic Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism,[49] Theyyam deities are propitiated through the rooster sacrifice where the religious cockfight is a religious exercise of offering blood to the Theyyam gods. Pongal or Makar Sankranti is a Hindu harvest festival. In southern state of Tamil Nadu and western state of Gujarat, an event of the celebrations is rooster fighting also known as Seval Sandai or Kozhi kettu. It is also practiced in Tulunadu.[50] Kozhi kettu organized as part of religious events are permitted.[51] Samaritanism[edit] Main article: Samaritans The Samaritans or \u0027Cutheans\u0027 are an ethnic group with a long history, once widely distributed and powerful. From Assyria they extended to India, China, Arabia Petraea and Abyssinia. They were also introduced by the Assyrian Empire into Samaria, in a policy of mass deportations. They had their Samaritan Temple on Mount Gerizim, opposite the Temple in Jerusalem, and they worshipped the Mesopotamian deity Nergal: his emblem was a cock (rooster).[52][53] Judaism[edit] The Zohar (iii. 22b, 23a, 49b), the book of Jewish mysticism and collection of writings on the Torah written by first century tannaic sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai (Rashbi), tells of a celestial manifestation, which causes the crowing of the roosters; known also in the Talmud, is \"blessed be He who has given the cock intelligence\", (Ber. 60b).[54] and as well as Job 38:36 in the Douay-Rheims Bible. Not only \"In the rabbinic literature, the cockcrow is used as general marking of time\",[55] but also some of the Sages interpreted the \"cockcrow\" to mean the voice of the Temple officer who summoned all priests, Levites, and Israelites to their duties and used as such because the Hebrew gever was used also to mean a \"rooster\" in addition to the meaning of \"man, strong man\".[56] The Talmud likewise provides the statement \"Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks\"[57] – (Jonathan ben Nappaha. Talmud: Erubin 100b), which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of \"a girt one of the loins\"(Young\u0027s Literal Translation) that which is \"stately in his stride\" and \"move with stately bearing\" within the Book of Proverbs 30:29-31. Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon (Saadia Gaon) identifies the definitive trait of \"a cock girded about the loins\" within Proverbs 30:31(Douay–Rheims Bible) as \"the honesty of their behavior and their success\",[58] identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious and spiritual instilling schema of purpose and use, within Judeo-Christian traditions. The Hebrew term zarzir, which literally means \"girt\"; \"that which is girt in the loins\" (BDB 267 s.v.) is recognized in the Targum as well as the Chaldaic, Syriac, Arabic, LXX and Vulgate with all referencing the fighting rooster or fighting cock as the religious vessel. The ancient Hebrew versions identified the Hebrew \"a girt one of the loins\" of Proverbs 30:31 as a rooster, \"which most of the old translations and Rabbis understood to be a fighting cock\",[59] with also the Arabic sarsar or sirsir being an onomatopoeticon or onomatopoeia for rooster (alektor) as the Hebrew zarzir of Proverbs 30:31. \"Rooster (Gallus domesticus) bones were identified at Lachish dating to early Iron II\",[60] but even earlier not to be ruled out, which corresponds was well with \"as for Palestine, the earliest chicken bones are present in Iron Age I strata in Lachish and Tell Hasben\".[61] Further we see the rooster placed within the Star of David, known in Hebrew as the Shield of David or Magen David and recognized of Jewish identity and Judaism. In excavations at Gibeon, near Jerusalem, dating to the seventh century B.C., potsherds were found incised with cocks and \"some of them placed within the six-pointed star of the Magen David\".[62] The seal of Jaazaniah carries the insignia of a rooster from the ruins of the biblical Judean kingdom at Mizpah, with the inscription of \"belonging to Jaazaniah, servant to the king\".,[63][64] the first known representation of the chicken in Palestine, and from II Kings 25:23, we know of one Jaazaniah the Maschathit, who was an official under Gedalish at Mizpah. Plutarch said the inhabitants of Caria carried the emblem of the rooster on the end of their lances and relates that origin to Artaxerxes, who awarded a Carian who was said to have killed Cyrus the Younger at the battle of Cunaxa in 401 B.C \"the privilege of carrying ever after a golden cock upon his spear before the first ranks of the army in all expeditions\"[65] and the Carians also wore crested helmets at the time of Herodotus, for which reason \"the Persians gave the Carians the name of cocks\".[66] It is Carites in 2 Kings 11 who were used by Jehoiada to protect Joash son of Ahaziah of the line of David, ancestor to Christ from Athaliah. In the Jewish religious practice of Kapparos, a rooster as a religious vessel is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. The meat is the distributed among the poor for their pre-fast meal. The purpose of the ritual is the expiation of sins of the man as the animal symbolically receives all the man\u0027s sins, which is based on the reconciliation of Isaiah 1:18. The religious practice is mentioned for the first time by Natronai ben Hilai, Gaon of the Academy of Sura in Babylonia, in 853 C.E., who describes it as a custom of the Babylonian Jews and further explained by Jewish scholars in the ninth century by that since the Hebrew word geber (Gever)[67] means both \"man\" and \"rooster\" the rooster may act or serve as a palpable substitute as a religious vessel in place of the man with the practice also having been as a custom of the Persian Jews. Christianity[edit] Good Shepherd fresco from the Catacombs of San Callisto with the cock at His right hand Vatican Persian Cock – A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian cock or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican (Holy See) in Rome dating to 600 C.E. Notice the halo denoting the status of being holy within that religious schema. In East Timor, one of the two predominately Christian nations in southeast Asia (the Philippines being the other), for some, the roof of the house is reserved for gods and spirits of ancestors, the lower portion remains for the nature spirit and usually occupied by animals, and the cock is admired because of courage and perseverance, with the courage of a man compared with that of the cock, with the cockfight occurring regularly and \"many tais designs include the cock\".[68] Reverend Dr. Kosuke Koyama\u0027s thoughts and words spreading the Christian gospel while in Indonesia of, this morning I say to myself, \"I will try to bring the gospel of Christ through the medium of cockfighting!\"[69] may be further understood not only in the spiritual understandings of many in Indonesia but further in the light of numerous representations of the rooster or cock as a religious vessel found in the Catacombs from the earliest period[8] including a painting from the Catacomb of St. Priscilla (mentioned in all the ancient liturgical sources and known as the \"Queen of the Catacombs\" in antiquity) reproduced in Giovanni Gaetano Bottari\u0027s folio of 1754, where the Good Shepherd is depicted as feeding the lambs, with a crowing cock on His right and left hand.[70] Likewise as well within the Christian \"Tomb of the Cocks\" in Beit Jibrin, which was a Palestinian Arab village located 13 miles northwest of the city of Hebron and part of the Kingdom of Israel, \"we find two spirited cocks painted in red in the spandrels with a cross just over the center of the arch\".[71] Similarly a multitude of sarcophagi are found with the rooster and the sacred cockfight with the understanding of striving for resurrection and eternal life in Christianity. This sacred subject carved on early Christian tombs, where the sepulchral carvings have an important purpose, \"a faithful wish for immortality, with the victory of the cock and his supporting genius analogous to the hope of resurrection, the victory of the soul over death\".[72] Similar illustrations of cocks in fighting stance [9] are found within the Vivian Bible as well as the fighting cocks capitals in the Basilica of St. Andoche in Saulieu[73] and the Cathédrale Saint-Lazare d\u0027Autun provides \"alternate documentation\"[74] of the rooster and the religious, spiritual and sacred cockfight. All four canonical gospels state that, either during or after the Last Supper, Jesus foretold of Peter\u0027s denial (Saint Peter) and that he would deny Christ three times before the cock\u0027s crow.[75] Augustine of Hippo, Catholic saint and pre-eminent Doctor of the Church understood \"a visible sign of an invisible reality\" of the rooster to include that as described by St. Augustine in DeOrdine as that which \"in every motion of these animals unendowed with reason there was nothing ungraceful since, of course, another higher reason was guiding everything they did\".[76] In the sixth century, it is reputed that Pope Gregory I declared the cock the emblem of Christianity saying the rooster was \"the most suitable emblem of Christianity\",[77] being \"the emblem of St Peter\".[78][79] Some say that it was as a result of this that the cock began to be used as a weather vane on church steeples, and some a Papal enactment of the ninth century ordered the figure of the cock to be placed on every church steeple.[80] It is known that Pope Leo IV had the figure of the cock placed on the Old St. Peter\u0027s Basilica or old Constantinian basilica[81] and has served as a religious icon and reminder of Peter\u0027s denial of Christ since that time, with some churches still having the rooster on the steeple today. Alternative theories about the origin of weathercocks on church steeples are that it was an emblem of the vigilance of the clergy calling the people to prayer,[82] that it was derived from the Goths[83] and is only possibly a Christian symbol,[84] and that it is an emblem of the sun.[85] The Vatican Persian cock denoting a sacred and religious vessel acknowledged by and from the Vatican, \"a girt one of the loins\" of Proverbs 30:31, the Hebrew zarzir, Arabic sarsar, Greek alektor, French coq, Persian bird, Persian cock or the acknowledged rooster from the Hebrew Torah, the Christian Old Testament, the Holy Scriptures of Job, Isaiah and of the Apostles John, Luke, Matthew and Mark, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ may still further be viewed through \"A Dictionary of the Bible\" which tells us that \"Pindar (ca. 522–443 BC), mentions the cock, Homer (ca. 800–750 BC) names a man \"gever\" the word for a cock and Aristophanes (ca. 446 BC – ca. 386 BC) calls it a Persian bird.\"[86] In the Bayeux Tapestry of the 1070s, originally of the Bayeux Cathedral and now exhibited at Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in Bayeux, Normandy, there is a depiction of a man installing a rooster on Westminster Abbey. The cornerstone is the first stone set in the construction of a masonry foundation and over time it became a ceremonial stone with the laying of the stone being generally important metaphorically in sacred architecture. Frazer (2006: p. 106) in The Golden Bough tells us that, \"In modern Greece, when the foundation of a new building is being laid, it is the custom to kill a cock, a ram, or a lamb, and to let its blood flow on the foundation-stone\". Islam[edit] The understanding of the divine spiritual endowment of the rooster within Islam, may be evidenced in the words of Muhammad of that Abrahamic religion in one of the six canonical hadith collections of Sunni Islam, stating that of \"when you hear the crowing of cocks, ask for Allah\u0027s Blessings for they have seen an angel\".[87] Shintoism[edit] Many roosters are found around Shinto shrines, with the rooster being associated with the sun goddess Amaterasu.[88] Taoism[edit] In Taoism, Hanshi and the spring Hanshi festival were when fires were not used and then relit. Since fire, like the cock a yang symbol and symbol of the sun, was temporarily extinguished and then relit. In a Tao religious aspect, to have a rooster fight another rooster, was the same in substance as a fire-renewal custom, where the rooster and the cockfight then takes its place as an indispensable spring ritual, and \"Taoism, which assessed it positively in this form, can be thought to have guaranteed its continued existence\".[89] The Hanshi festival was eventually moved to coincide with the Qingming Festival or the Pure Brightness Festival which still includes the rooster and cockfight.[90] Zoroastrianism[edit] Zoroastrianism, claimed to be \"the oldest of the revealed world-religions\"[91] and founded by the Prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra) opposed animal sacrifices but held the rooster as a \"symbol of light\"[92] and associated the cock with \"good against evil\"[92] because of his heraldic actions. In Iran during the Kianian Period, from about 2000 B.C. to about 700 B.C., among domestic birds, \"the cock was the most sacred\"[12] and within that religion, the devout, \"had a cock to guard him and ward off evil spirits\".[93] Emblems[edit] The flag of Wallonia features a red rooster Rooster on the coat of arms of Tomilino (Moscow Oblast, Russia) The cockerel was already of symbolic importance in Gaul at the time of the invasion of Julius Caesar and was associated with the god Lugus.[citation needed] Today the Gallic rooster is an emblem of France. The rooster is also an emblem of Wallonia and the Turkish city of Denizli. Among Roman deities, Priapus was sometimes represented as a cock, with its beak as a phallus and its wattles as testicles. The cock or a man with rooster attributes was similarly used as an erotic symbol, Priapus Gallinaceus[94] The Cockburn clan in Scotland use the cock as their badge. Their canting coat-of-arms is Argent three cocks gules, and their motto is ACCENDIT CANTU (Latin: He rouses us with song).[95] A fighting cockerel on a ball is the symbol of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. The cockerel wears a pair of spurs which is a reference to the club\u0027s nickname. It has been present on their crest and shield since 1901. Additionally, the cockerel is the emblem of Turkish sports club Denizlispor, which was founded in 1966. Also, the supporters of the club are called cockerels. Another soccer club that uses a rooster as its symbol is the Clube Atlético Mineiro, from Brazil. The supporters of the club and the supporters of other Brazilian clubs, often refer to Mineiro as \"Galo\", which means rooster in Portuguese. The \"Crazy Rooster\", a symbol of Clube Atlético Mineiro. In Australia, the Sydney Roosters, who play in the National Rugby League have adopted the cockerel as its emblem. The Roosters\u0027 emblem is a cock with its comb fashioned to represent the Sydney Opera House. Jesus College in the University of Cambridge features roosters on its coat of arms, which is a pun on the name of the college\u0027s founder, John Alcock.[96] The University of South Carolina features a Gamecock, or fighting cockerel, as its mascot for all athletic programs. The Coat of arms of Kenya features a rooster holding an axe. The emblem of Chianti Classico is a black rooster.[97] A black cockerel was believed in medieval times to be a symbol of witchcraft along with the black cat,[98] with the rooster \"used as symbols of either virtue or vice\"[99] until modern times.
